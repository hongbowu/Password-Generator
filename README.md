As a software developer, I have created this Password Generator with user preferences in mind. The following features are incorporated to enhance user experience:

1.Four options for password components: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special 2.characters.
2.Users can select any combination or a single option to randomly generate a password between 8 and 128 characters.
